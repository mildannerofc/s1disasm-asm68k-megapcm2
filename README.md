# Sonic 1 GitHub ASM68K with Mega PCM 2
This is fully translated Sonic 1 GitHub AS Mega PCM Implementation with ASM68K lines and following Hivebrain a bit.

After implementing Mega PCM 2, I would make a guide for it but I didn't have any idea to translate the guide from AS to ASM68K by respecting the Sound Driver base and structure.

It may be not secure if you are currently using this as base.

## Known issues
* Cheats aren't working (Is it be good for your ROM Hack with no people tampering with it?)
* Every people say that you can add Mega PCM to ASM68K but with replacing from `.` to `@`
* ASM68K is said by own vladikcomper that's slower than Macro AS
* It may be straight off than the current disassembly

If you have anything to fix, just make a pull request and I'll handle it.
