# Sonic 1 GitHub ASM68K with Mega PCM 2
This is fully translated Sonic 1 GitHub AS Mega PCM Implementation with ASM68K lines and following Hivebrain a bit.

After implementing Mega PCM 2, I would make a guide for it but I didn't have any idea to translate the guide from AS to ASM68K by respecting the Sound Driver.

It may be not secure if you are currently using this as base.

## Known issues
* Cheats aren't working (Is it be good for your ROM Hack with no people tampering with it?)
* ASM68K is said by own vladikcomper that's slower than Macro AS
* It may be off than the current disassembly

If you have anything to fix, just make a pull request and I'll handle it.
